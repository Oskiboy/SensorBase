# SensorBase
## Introduction:
This project is my first solo C++ project, it is a way for me to challenge my own skills in programming and use what I have learned in other courses. It should encompass circuitry design, sensoring and programming. The final product should be easily expanded with more sensors and easily built and managed.
## Goals:
- The project should be easily expanded with more sensors.
- Logging errors, warnings and data should be easy to read and robust.
- The system should run 24/7 and be foolproof regarding error readings and other external errors.
